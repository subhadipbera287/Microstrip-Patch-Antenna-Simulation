# Microstrip Patch Antenna Design and Simulation

This project involves the simulation and optimization of a rectangular microstrip patch antenna for improved wireless communication using Ansys HFSS.

## 🎯 Objective
To design a patch antenna with optimized return loss and bandwidth for 2.4 GHz ISM band using HFSS.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- ANSYS HFSS
- MATLAB (optional post-processing)
- Windows OS

## ⚙️ Project Components
- Substrate selection (FR4)
- Patch design and dimension calculation
- Parametric optimization using HFSS
- Return loss (S11) and radiation pattern simulation

## 📁 Files Included
- HFSS Project File (.hfss)
- Design screenshots
- Result graphs (S11, Gain, Radiation Pattern)

## 📝 Results
- Return Loss: ~-20 dB at 2.4 GHz
- Bandwidth: ~100 MHz
- Gain: ~6 dBi (directional)

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Design for dual-band or circular polarization
- Fabrication and hardware testing
